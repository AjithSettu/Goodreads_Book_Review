-- Q/A ANALYSIS:
-- 1)What are the most popular books and authors? What about the most controversial?
-- The most popular books - Books with highest number of ratings

select max(ratings_count) as ratings_count,work_id,original_title from goodreads_works
group by work_id,original_title order by max(ratings_count) desc;

-- The most Popular authors - author with highest number of reviews_count

select max(reviews_count) as reviews_count,author,original_title from goodreads_works

-- The most controversial books - Books with low number of ratings

-- The controversial authors - books with low number of reviews_count.

select max(reviews_count) as reviews_count,author,original_title from goodreads_works
group by author,original_title order by max(reviews_count) asc;

-- 2)Which genres have the highest reader engagement? What are their most popular books?

create temporary table temp_genre as(

-- To find the maximum number of genre contains for a single book.
select length(genres)-length(replace(genres,',','')),original_title

-- 3)Who are the highest-rated authors?
-- How have their works trended by publication year?

-- 4)Do longer reviews get more "helpful" votes? 
-- What about reviews with extreme ratings (1 or 5 stars)?

--Counting sum of 1_star ratings.
select sum(1_star_ratings) as count_of_1_star_ratings,
